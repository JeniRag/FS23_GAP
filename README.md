# FS23_GAP
My workflow of my Master's Thesis "Machine Learning the Equation of State of Dense Hydrogen using Gaussian Approximation Potential".
Still in Progress.

* notebooks contain jupyter notebook folders
	1_PrepareData.ipynb: example to extract frames and store in.xyz file. (example data used in notebook not included)
	2_ReducedGradientModel.ipynb: example to train and test GAP model.
* intermediate_data contains a demo file used in 2_ReducedGradientModel.ipynb
